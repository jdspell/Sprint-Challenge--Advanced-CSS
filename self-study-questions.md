1. An adaptive website is made to accomodate different devices, but a fixed design is created at each breakpoint. Responsive websites use responsive units to configurte the site for various devices so that breakpoints are seemless between devices.

2. This is a design pattern for how the developer creates the site where the initial design either starts with a desktop or mobile device. Then the design flows towards the device that was not picked to start(if you picked desktop then you design this first then move onto mobile).

3. This makes it so that 1rem unit will be equal to 10px so that the design process does not waste time converting units.

4. Preprocessing allows for css to written in a cleaner more readable syntx speeding up the design process. Then the preprocessor code is compiled into regular css.

5. I enjoy escaping as it makes the @media tag more readable so other programmers know which device you are refering to. I struggled with mixins when I started as I was not sure when to use them exactly.
